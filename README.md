# checkerAI

Going to make a checker enviroment in processing - allowing the use to be able to choose what type of play they want to do and then also have different types of learning agent for it to play against 

Agent class - superclass 
Then all the others are sub classes of this
- Minimax 
- alpha beta search 
- MCTS - Node and Search class 

Board stored on 2D arrray 
- follow the structure of the seoul ai since

Maybe have some more complex learning ones in there - that will do as a start though 

In the future be able to add more games into it
